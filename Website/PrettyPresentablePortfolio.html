                <h3 id="about_me_history_header"><u>History</u></h3>
                <p>I've lived in West Monroe, LA my whole life. My passion 
                    for computer science started early in high school when I attended a college major fair 
                    at the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM). The fair included a booth for computer 
                    science, and after getting a rundown of the vast field of computer science, I was intrigued.
                    <br><br>By 11th grade I started taking computer science courses at school, and I eventually went on 
                    to major in the field - and have loved it ever since.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="about_me_r2c_header"><u>Reasons To Code</u></h3>
                <p>So why do I love working in the field of computer science?<br><br>
                    It's simple: I love solving problems.<br><br>
                    In the last five years I've worked in computer science and have learned that solving problems with technology 
                    enables solutions not otherwise attainable by other means. The complexity and flexibility of computer systems allows us 
                    to achieve goals that many who came before us thought were impossible. Who wouldn't be excited about that?</p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="about_me_offline_header"><u>Offline</u></h3>
                <p>In addition to my love of technology, I have other personal hobbies including reading (the current book I'm reading can be seen below), playing video games (a nerd at heart), 
                    and getting out in nature and exploring what the world has to offer. I'm never afraid to try something new. Never know until you try. 
                    I also love taking care of my dog Nala (also seen below).</p>

                <h3 id="about_me_looking_aheader"><u>Looking Ahead</u></h3>
                <p>My graduation date is May 2023. I'm in the process of searching for a job, and when I do get a job, I look forward to expanding my knowledge in a challenging, dynamic work environment and bringing my problem solving, 
                    leadership and technology skills to help enable any company’s goals.</p>
